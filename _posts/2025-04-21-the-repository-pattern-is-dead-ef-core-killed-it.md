# 🪦 The Repository Pattern is Dead. EF Core Killed It.

> Let’s stop pretending.

---

## ⚰️ In 2025, if you're still wrapping EF Core with a `UserRepository` that does nothing but call `DbContext.Users`—

**You’re not writing a “pattern.” You’re adding ceremony.**

---

## 🏛️ EF Core is Your Repository

EF Core gives you:

- ✨ **IQueryable magic**
- 🧱 **Unit of Work**
- 🔄 **Change Tracking**
- 🗂️ **Projection, Pagination, Filtering**
- 📝 **Raw SQL when you really need it**

---

🤔 **So what exactly are you “abstracting”?**

Most repositories today are glorified `.ToListAsync()` wrappers—adding zero value while hiding EF's power.

---

## 🧹 You Don’t Need a Repository. You Need Clean Use Cases.

Let EF Core do what it does best—  
**Stop suffocating your architecture with outdated patterns.**

---

## 💬 Agree or disagree? Let’s debate.
